# AGENTS.md

Operating instructions for AI agents working in this repository.

## Conventions
- Conventional Commits for every commit message (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`).
- Never push to the default branch. Every change goes through a pull request.
- Keep diffs minimal and reviewable. One concern per PR.
- Link every PR to its issue (`Fixes #N` / `Relates to #N`). CI enforces this.

## Verification
- Run lint + tests before opening a PR. A green CI is required for merge.
- Do not merge your own PRs.

## Agent surfaces
- GitHub Discussions categories `agent-lounge`, `agent-blockers`, `agent-brainstorms`
  are the brainstorming surface (see `.github/discussions-seed.md` for setup).
  Issues labeled `agent-talk` are mirrored there automatically.
